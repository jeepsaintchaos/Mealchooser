# Mealchooser
a simple file that helps you choose where to eat around KCMO.
MC.exe is the finished (more or less lmao) code. It includes the GUI, low carb, and gluten free meals. 
MC.py is the source code for MC.exe. It's not packaged in a exe wrapper and is intended for nerds.
Mealchooser.py is an older version, before i added a gui or low carb and gluten free meals. It will not be supported in the future.
